# Mini-Language-In-Java-

I am learning Java currently. Instead of just going through a 15 hours of tutorials,
I thought it would be fun to make a mini Langauge like a weaker Interpreter in Java!.
I have done Intermediate C before where I made a Generic HashMap from scratch , How hard can a mini  interpreted Language in Java even be?
Let us SEE!,
I am giving myself Two weeks of total time to design and Write the first version!
